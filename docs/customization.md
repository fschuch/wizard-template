# Customization

You can adapt this template to fit your project's needs. Common customizations include:

- Renaming the project and author (use `hatch run _wizard`)
- Editing dependencies and environments in [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml)
- Adjusting pre-commit hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Modifying CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Updating documentation in `docs/`

For more, see the [Hatch documentation](https://hatch.pypa.io/), [pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/), and [Jupyter Book docs](https://jupyterbook.org/).
