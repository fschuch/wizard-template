# Quality Assurance

This template is designed with production-readiness in mind, integrating a suite of tools to enforce code quality, consistency, and reliability. Each tool is pre-configured in the project and can be customized as needed.

Automated quality assurance (QA) ensures that your codebase remains clean, maintainable, and free of common errors. By leveraging static analysis, linting, type checking, and automated testing, you reduce the risk of bugs and technical debt.
